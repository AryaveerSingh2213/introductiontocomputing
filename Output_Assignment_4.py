Done!

Enter the first number :50
enter the second number :8

The quotient is : 6
The remainder is : 2

 The resulting list is : [6, 2]

 The function is callable : True

 The first number is zero: False
 The second number is zero: False
 The quotient is zero : False
 The remainder is zero : False

 Adding (4, 5, 6) to the resulting list , we have :  [6, 2, 4, 5, 6]

The values greater than four are : [6, 5, 6]

 Converting the resulting list into a set ,we have :  {5, 6}

 The required immutable set is : frozenset({5, 6})

The required maximum value is : 6
The required hash value is : 6
